* index.html is the main directory for java documentation under ./Code and javadoc/javadoc/

* If there is any problem with accessing the code, you may find the source code on github: https://github.com/maffinnn/CZ2002-Assignment

* If the code does not run on your PC, probably it is due to the different convention of directory address in your PC e.g. in windows system "restaurant\database\somefile.txt"

  â€‹	   in MacOs "./restaurant/database/somefile.txt"

  Please change them (relevant code mainly in Restaurant.java and TableManager.java) to a compatible one on your PC if you find any run-time error.
